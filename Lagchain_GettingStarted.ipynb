You can upload test cases in bulk, create them on the fly, or export them from application traces. LangSmith also supports custom evaluations to score test results.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Comparison View: When prototyping different versions of your applications and making changes, it's important to see if you've regressed with respect to your initial test cases. LangSmith offers a user-friendly comparison view for test runs, allowing you to track and diagnose regressions in test scores across multiple revisions of your application.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. Beta Testing: During the beta testing phase, LangSmith helps you collect more data on how your LLM applications are performing in real-world scenarios. You can gather human feedback on the responses your app is producing and attach feedback scores to logged traces. This feedback can be used to track regressions/improvements and develop automatic evaluations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Production Monitoring & Automations: Once your LLM application hits production, LangSmith allows you to closely inspect key data points, monitor metrics over time, and perform actions on traces in near real-time through automations. This helps you ensure that your application is delivering desirable results at scale and enables debugging of production issues.\n",
